Question: Flipping an image

Code:
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> flipAndInvertImage(vector<vector<int>>& image) {
        int c=0;
        int length=image.size();
        int maxl=length;
        if(length%2!=0) length=(length+1)/2;
        else length=length/2;
        for(int i=0;i<maxl;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<length;j++){
                c=image[i][j];
                image[i][j]=image[i][maxl-j-1];
                image[i][maxl-j-1]=c;
            }
        }
        for(int k=0;k<maxl;k++){
            for(int l=0;l<maxl;l++){
                image[k][l]=1-image[k][l];
            }
        }    
        return image;
    }
};

Approach:
1> Took the size of vector.
2> Divided cases for odd and even size vectors.
3> For Odd size vectors we will swap the outer numbers and the inner number will remain as it is.
4> For Even size vectors since all are outer numbers, they will be swaped accordingly.
5> Then a new vector will be created which I seperately reversed with nested loop.(Could have also done this in same loop with some changes).
